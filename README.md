# Free Monad Fail State

This is n experiment with adding support for a BiBind function on a Free monad in C#.

The Free monad is based on the code-gen Free from https://github.com/louthy/language-ext

The experiment here is the FailNext field on the non-pure/leaf nodes of the tree that is generated by the monad.
This FailNext field is managed by the additional BiBind function on the Free.
This enables the monad to generate a tree that can contain alternate failure flows that the Interpreter can then selectively use in the case of a failure for a given DSL action.

An example stack-safe interpreter is included.

The tests show how BiBind function can be used to recover from a failure.
Note. BiBind also enables the ability to hook into the failed state throughout the flow of the application for logging etc.
